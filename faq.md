**Affiliations**
- _Are you a part of the Drupal Association?_
      No. We're a collective of volunteers.

- _Didn't you have space in the Drupal Association's booth at DrupalCon Baltimore?_
Yep. They donated it to us.

- _Why?_
Honestly, we didn't ask. We don't have the money to buy a booth space, so we took the gift we were offered.

- _Did Dries have anything to do with it?_
Nope.

**Funding**

We are a collective of volunteers that neither handles money nor has a way to receive or disburse funds.  

- _Who bought the booth space?_
No one. The Drupal Association donated it.

- _Who paid for the stickers?_
Digital Echidna, and they asked to do so anonymously.

- _Who paid for the photo booth supplies?_
We posted an Amazon Wishlist and organization(s) bought items from it.  We have no way of knowing who bought what.

**Membership and Opinions**
- _Who speaks for the group?_
No one. All text that appears on the website is crowd-sourced. Our twitter is run by @Ruby, but she writes only informational text, not opinion text. HALP WITH THIS part

- _"I saw @username say 'controversial thing' on twitter. Does DD&I believe the same thing?"_
We're made up of individuals who have their own opinions.  All of them are free to speak their minds in every venue in which they participate.

- _What is your position on [controversial person or situation]._
We don't have one.
